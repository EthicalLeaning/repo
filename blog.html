                        <p style="font-size: 19px;font-family: Amita, cursive;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ethical Hacking is an authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber&nbsp; security
                            engineers&nbsp;to perform such activities in order to test the systemâ€™s defenses. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and
                            more importantly, legal.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ethical Hacker&nbsp;aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze
                            the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, &nbsp;they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.<br></p>

                        <p style="font-family: Amita, cursive;font-size: 19px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Learning ethical hacking involves studying the mindset and techniques of black hat hackers and testers to learn how to identify and correct vulnerabilities within networks. Studying ethical
                            hacking can be applied by security pros across industries and in a multitude of sectors.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sphere includes network defender, risk management, and quality
                            assurance tester.&nbsp;However, the most obvious benefit of learning ethical hacking is its potential to inform and improve and defend corporate networks. The primary threat to any organization's security is a hacker: learning,
                            understanding, and implementing how hackers operate can help network defenders prioritize potential risks and learn how to remediate them best.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, getting an ethical hacking
                            training or certifications can benefit those who are seeking a new role in the security realm or those wanting to demonstrate skills and quality to their organization.<br><br></p>
